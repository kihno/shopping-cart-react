# Shopping cart using react-query

Build a simple shopping cart using [react-query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/quick-start) to fetch the data.
The app should have a simple layout, with the products available on the left side of the page and the shopping cart on the right side.

Users should be able to:

- see a list of products
- see their shopping cart
- add/remove products to the shopping cart
- increase or decrease the quantity of the products in the cart
- see the total price of their cart

If no product was added to the shopping cart, the page should say: “You haven’t added anything to your shopping cart yet.”
If the quantity of a product is greater than 3 items, add a 10% discount for that product.

The list of products can be retrieved from a mock API that is included in this starter repo.
Fork the repo on Github and get started!

What you’ll practice:

- structuring the component tree
- sharing state across components
- combining server state with local state
- working with derived state
